#  This file is used to store environment-specific variables such as API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information that shouldn't be hardcoded into your application files.

#  Do: Use this file to manage different configurations for development, testing, and production environments. Ensure that it is added to your .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked by version control systems (e.g., Git).

# Do not: Commit the .env file to public repositories or share it. Always keep sensitive keys and configurations private to ensure the security of your app and its data.
